     Here's a breakdown of each folder and its purpose:

    node_modules: This is where all the project's dependencies are stored after being installed via npm.

    public: This folder is where publicly accessible static assets are placed. This includes images, fonts, and the favicon (favicon.ico) that appears in browser tabs.

    styles: This folder is for global CSS or styling-related files. The globals.css file is automatically imported and applied to your entire application.

    components: This folder is for reusable React components that can be used across multiple pages. It's a good practice to separate UI components from page-level components.

    pages: This is where you define the routes of your application. Each .js or .tsx file corresponds to a route. For example, index.js represents the home page, and about.js represents the about page.

    src: This folder is optional and not part of the standard Next.js convention. Some projects might use it to organize additional source code files.

    package.json: This file contains your project's metadata, such as the project name, version, and dependencies. You can also define scripts for tasks like starting the development server.

    next.config.js: This file is optional and is used to configure Next.js settings, such as custom webpack configuration, environment variables, and more.

    README.md: This is where you can provide documentation for your project. It's often used to describe how to set up the project, its purpose, and any important instructions.
